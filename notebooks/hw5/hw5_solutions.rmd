# 1) Local linear regression (LOESS)

Here we define a function to perform LOESS regression as a function of 1-dimensional data, a bandwidth parameter, and the number of (evenly spaced) points to predict over.

First define some utility functions, for:

- array normalization
- point normalization
- weight distribution (tricubic bell curve)

```{r}
# set the random seed
set.seed(42)
```

# 2) Kernel density estimation

Here we define a function to perform KDE.

First define some utility functions, for:

- the kernel (normal distribution)
-
